/**
 * A class that collects the definition of signals that can be triggered
 * at different points in a computation. A signal is in essence an event
 * that is triggered whenever the program passes a certain point in a
 * computation. Parties interested in any of these signals can attach
 * "slots" to a signal. A slot is, in essence, a function that is called
 * whenever the signal is triggered. Multiple slots (or none) can be
 * attached to the same signal. To be as general as possible, slots are
 * not actually just pointers to functions, but std::function objects
 * that have a certain signature. Consequently, they can have much more
 * complicated types than just function pointers, such as objects with
 * an <code>operator()</code> or function calls treated with things
 * like std::bind.
 *
 * The documentation of each of the signals below indicates when
 * exactly it is called.
